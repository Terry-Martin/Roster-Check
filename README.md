# Roster Calculator

The purposes of this website is to provide a roster calculator for medium to large size companies. The user will select the number of weeks and the table wil display prompting a start time and end end time for each day. The calculator is geared towards a paid hours calculation, so if the user selects unpaid breaks, these hours will be removed. 

With large scale companies, it is common to have mutiple rosters to cover all their internal teams and roles. These can be beome quite complex when tryng to match hours against changing busy periods or seasonal trends.

One of the mian considerations when creating a roster is to ensure the hours in the roster matches the employee contracted hours ob avger over the length of the roster (1 week or muttiple weeks). This calculator shows the use the average hours and they can then edit the times, if eeded, to bring the average to the 40 hours (or whatever contract the employee has)

### Existing Features

  - These are the first 2 user inputs needed. 
  - The number of weeks determines how many lines in the roster.
  - Paid or unpaid breaks will effect the calculation for shift length. This is beacuse the shift length that is being caluclated is paid hours. This should match back to an employees contracted weekly hours.


__Enter Daily Start and End times__

  - ![Input table](assets/images/input-table.jpg)

  - This is straight forward calculation of the total number of shifts hours divided by the number of weeks.
  - The average weekly hours are displayed as readonly
  - The average weekly hours should be a check against whatever contracted hours a particular mployee has

__Next Steps__
  - Although mobile first is the recomended approach, for this particular pfoject, the recoended viewing is on a tablet or above. The reason for this is that weekly view is needed. Further disign would be needed to optimise this site for mobiles with the lielihood being a day view for each day of the roser rather than a weekly view but this too would be probleatic on rosters longer than 2 or 3 weeks.

  - Also, most robost checks are needed to ensure user does not select a roster below zero length shift.
